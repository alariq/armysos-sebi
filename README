This repo has several small projects:
1) bt_sync - data agnostic app which transferes data over bluetooth.
2) mark_sync - app which uses bt_sync to sync simple map marks.
3) mark_provider - android content provider for marks storage along with simple demo app MarksBrowser.

To use mark_provider you need to also add <user-permissions>.
For reading add: 
	com.uarmy.art.mark_provider.provider.permission.READ_PROVIDER
for writing:
        com.uarmy.art.mark_provider.provider.permission.WRITE_PROVIDER

For examples of using amrks content provider refer to MarksBrowser demo app. I've added a lot of comments there. It is very easy.


to get files:
1) git clone git@github.com:alariq/armysos-sebi.git
this will sync files and sreate armysos-sebi folder

2) start Android Studio
3) select Open Project
4) point to armysos-sebi directory and click OK using mouse (Enter on directory, for some reason, will not open)
5) do you stuff


P.S. By default starting application will be MarkSync. To start MarkBrowser go to Run->Edit Configurations -> Activity -> Launch : and type:
	com.uarmy.art.mark_provider.MarksBrowser
or press '...' and start typeing MarkBrowser then select it from suggestion.



Have fun.
