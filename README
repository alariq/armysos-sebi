This repo has several small projects:
1) bt_sync - data agnostic app which transferes data over bluetooth.
2) mark_sync - app which uses bt_sync to sync simple map marks.
3) mark_provider - android content provider for marks storage along with simple demo app MarksBrowser.

To use mark_provider you need to also add <user-permissions>.
For reading add: 
	com.uarmy.art.mark_provider.provider.permission.READ_PROVIDER
for writing:
        com.uarmy.art.mark_provider.provider.permission.WRITE_PROVIDER

For examples of using amrks content provider refer to MarksBrowser demo app. I've added a lot of comments there. It is very easy.

Have fun.
